# 1 Proxy 介绍

**Proxyies are useful for many purposes**

* proxies are used in firewalls, so that browsers behind a firewall can only contact a server beyond the firewall via the proxy
* Proxies can also act as anonymizers by stripping requests of all identifyin infromation
    * a proxy can make the browser anonymous to Web Servers
* Proxies can also be used to cache web objects by storing local copies of objects from servers then responding to future requests by reaidng them out of its cache rather than by communcaing again with remote servers
